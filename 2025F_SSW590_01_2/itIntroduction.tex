 SSW-590: DevOps Principles and Practices (Fall 2025) teaches the culture, principles, and tools behind modern DevOps. It covers software lifecycles, configuration management, automated testing, code infrastructure, monitoring, and containerization. It allows students to apply these in AWS with Docker through a hands-on service implementation, tying DevOps practices back to core software engineering life-cycle concepts.
